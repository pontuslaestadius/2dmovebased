# Introduction

This was initially a school project developed in 2013, thus all comments are in Swedish (How fun!) and basically breaks every modern software pattern.

The unaltered files are located in the "raw" directory, while a _modernized_ version exists in the "refactor" direcrory.

The index.html file in the top directory provides an iframe comparison between the two versions.

Serve them however you want, e.g. "python3 -m http.server"
